Description:

SEO Rank Checker
This tool is written with a backend in .NET5.0 (dotnet core) and a simple frontend in ReactJS.
To run it a couple of steps are needed.
It is preferable to use VSCode, as MS has deprecated the ability to load SPA sites using Visual Studio in .NET5.0 currently.
Visual Studio can be used for debugging the backend - to do so the frontend proxy must be correctly set to the backend SSL port that Visual Studio exposes (usually 44316).
Visual Studio can also be used to run the unit tests, however the latest version of VS is necessary to support .NET5.0.
The proxy must be set in the package.json file. It is currently set to "proxy": "https://localhost:5001" which is what running the dotnet code via VSCode will use.

To run using VSCode:
    Navigate to the ~\SettleSearch directory
    Open VSCode in this directory by typing 'code .' in a command shell.
    Open the terminal in vscode with [ctrl] + `
    Type 'dotnet run' and enter.
    The webserver will start and the console logs will appear in this terminal console.
    Add another terminal - no matter the type.
    Type 'cd .\client-app'
    Type 'npm start'
    The fron-end will open.

The google and bing results should load up after a short while. They will cache a copy for one hr for every distinct search term and search engine.
If not then an error message will show. It is likely an internet issue or a proxy issue.

Other searches can be tried - e.g. see the difference between 'e-settlement' rather than 'e-settlements', as can other sites.
